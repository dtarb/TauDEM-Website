<h1>Grid Defintions and Naming Conventions</h1>
<p></p>
<p>To manage the variety of data, especially grid data, used by TauDEM, a naming convention relying on suffixes appended to the body of file names has been developed to identify the contents of the files used. This convention is not required, but makes things a lot easier and is used to set up default file names. Each type of file is associated with a suffix that is appended to the main part of the file name, before the extension used by the computer system. If the Base Elevation grid name is "nnnn[.tif]" then the remaining file names will be "nnnnsss[.tif/shp/txt]" where sss is the suffix. The table below gives DEM grids used by TauDEM with these suffixes.</p>
