<h1>TauDEM Tools</h1>
<p></p>
<p>TauDEM (Terrain analysis using Digital Elevation Models) is a set of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) analysis tools developed by David Tarboton and students and colleagues in his group over the years with support from a variety of sponsors, whose support is gratefully acknowledged.   These tools are targeted at extraction of information useful for hydrologic modeling and analysis from DEMs.</p>
<p>The TauDEM Toolbox currently provides the following capability: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pit removal by flooding to ensure hydraulic connectivity within the watershed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Computation of flow directions and slopes using single and multiple flow direction methods.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Contributing area using single and multiple flow direction methods.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Multiple methods for the delineation of channel networks including geomorphology-based methods sensitive to spatially variable drainage density.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Objective methods for determination of the channel network delineation threshold based on stream drop analysis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Delineation of watersheds and subwatersheds draining to each stream segment and association between watershed and segment attributes for setting up hydrologic models. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Specialized functions for terrain analysis, including: </li>
</ul>
<dl>
    <dt></dt>
    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Slope over specific catchment area ratio which is the inverse of the wetness index.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Distances down to streams and up to ridges along flow directions measured horizontally, vertically, in a straight line, or following the topographic profile.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Upslope dependence function to map the locations upslope where activities have an effect on a downslope location.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Decaying accumulation that evaluates upslope contribution subject to decay or attenuation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Concentration limited accumulation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Transport limited accumulation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Reverse accumulation.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Avalanche runout.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Average slope.</li>
